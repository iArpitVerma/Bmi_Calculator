# BMI Calculator ðŸ’ª

## Goal

The objective of this repository is to look at how we can customise Flutter Widgets to achieve our own beautiful user interface designs. If you have a designer on board, no matter how unconventional their designs are, you can create them using Flutter. 


## What is this project

I created a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It is a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.
